# <div align="center">CSD OPTIMADE API</div>

This repo contains prototyping work for creating an [OPTIMADE
API](https://optimade.org) for searching and accessing structures
from the [Cambridge Structural Database (CSD)](https://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/structures).

The structures are accessed via the [CSD Python
API](https://downloads.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/documentation/API/) and cast to the
OPTIMADE format; the
[`optimade-maker`](https://github.com/materialscloud-org/optimade-maker/) and
[`optimade-python-tools`](https://github.com/Materials-Consortia/optimade-python-tools/)
are then used to launch a local OPTIMADE API.

## Installation

After cloning this repository and using some appropriate method of creating a virtual environment (current recommendation is [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)), this package can be installed with

```shell
git clone git@github.com:datalab-industries/csd-optimade
cd csd-optimade
uv sync --extra-index-url https://pip.ccdc.cam.ac.uk
```

or

```shell
git clone git@github.com:datalab-industries/csd-optimade
cd csd-optimade
pip install . --extra-index-url https://pip.ccdc.cam.ac.uk
```

Note that the extra index URL is required to install the `csd-python-api` package.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Any attempts to use CSD data will additionally require a CSD license and [appropriate configuration](https://downloads.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/documentation/API/installation_notes.html#installation-options).


## Usage

### Ingesting CSD data

The CSD can be ingested into the OPTIMADE format using the `csd-ingest` entrypoint:

```shell
csd-ingest
```

This will use multiple processes (controlled by `--num-processes`) to ingest the
local copy of the CSD database in chunks of size `--chunk-size` until the target
`--num-structures` has been reached (defaults to the entire CSD).
Each batch will be written to an [OPTIMADE JSONLines file](https://github.com/Materials-Consortia/OPTIMADE/pull/531),
and combined into a single JSONLines file (~ 5.5 GB for the entire CSD, or 2 GB compressed) on completion, with name
`<--run-name>-optimade.jsonl`.

Depending on parallelisation, this process should take a few minutes to ingest
the entire CSD on consumer hardware (around 10 minutes with 8 processes on an AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 7840U mobile
processor, requiring around 3 GB of RAM per process with the default chunk size of 100k).

### Creating an OPTIMADE API

The `csd-serve` entrypoint provides a thin wrapper around the
[`optimade-maker`](https://github.com/materialscloud-org/optimade-maker/) tool,
and bundles the simple configuration required to launch a local OPTIMADE API
with a simple in-memory database (if `--mongo-uri` is provided, a real MongoDB
backend will be used).
Just provide the path to your combined OPTIMADE JSONLines file:

```shell
csd-serve <path-to-optimade-jsonl>
```

You should now be able to try out some queries locally, either in the browser or
with a tool like `curl`:

```shell
curl http://localhost:5000/structures?filter=elements HAS "C"
```

## Containerized version

For ease of deployment, as containerised version of the ingestion pipeline is available.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You should verify that your license agreement allows for any kind of deployment outside of your private network; it likely does not.

To build the container from scratch, you need both a time-limited CSD installer
download link (`CSD_INSTALLER_URL`), and your activation key
(`CSD_ACTIVATION_KEY`).

> [!NOTE]
> As of January 2025, you can request your time-limited CSD installer link at https://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/support-and-resources/download-the-csd/. Once you receive the email, the `CSD_INSTALLER_URL` should be the one listed as "CSD Portfolio <version> Linux Online Installer (recommended, small download)".

These should be stored in a `.env` file that is available both at build time and runtime.
Note, managing these secrets requires a recent Docker version that includes
Buildx.

Once configured, you can build the container with

```shell
docker build --secret id=env,src=.env --target csd-optimade-server -t csd-optimade-server .
```

This will install the CSD inside the container, run the ingestion pipeline and
prepare an encrypted version of the CSD in the OPTIMADE JSONLines format.
The file can be decrypted with your `CSD_ACTIVATION_KEY`.

To launch the container (which will decrypt the file and start the OPTIMADE
API locally):

```shell
docker run --env-file .env -p 5000:5000 csd-optimade-server
```

If using a persistent database, future runs of the API can be controlled with
the `CSD_OPTIMADE_INSERT` environment variable. If `true`, the configured database will be


For development and deployment, you may prefer to use the bake definitions in
`docker-bake.hcl` to build and tag the relevant build stages:

```shell
docker buildx bake csd-optimade-server
docker run --env-file .env -p 5000:5000 ghcr.io/datalab-industries/csd-optimade-server
```

### Runtime configuration options

As noted above, the `CSD_ACTIVATION_KEY` used to build the container must be provided at runtime.

The API container can also be configured with all the `OPTIMAKE_` prefixed environment variables.

The most important ones are listed here:

- `OPTIMAKE_MONGO_URI`: to use a persistent MongoDB backend, you can provide a `MONGO_URI` via:

  ```shell
  OPTIMAKE_DATABSE_BACKEND=mongodb
  OPTIMAKE_MONGO_URI=mongodb://mongodb_server:27017/optimade
  ```

- `OPTIMAKE_BASE_URL`: to set the base URL of the API (used to generate pagination links), you can provide a `BASE_URL` via:

  ```shell
  OPTIMAKE_BASE_URL=https://my-csd-deployment.com
  ```

Finally, if using a persistent database, future runs of the API can be controlled with the `CSD_OPTIMADE_INSERT` environment variable.
If `true` (default), the configured database will be wiped and rebuilt from the JSONL file directly, and a separate process will run the API.
If `false`, only the API will be started, with no database rebuild.
